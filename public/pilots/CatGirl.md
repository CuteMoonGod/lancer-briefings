Ash enlisted in the Khaliani military at a young age. She excelled at all marksmanship tests as well as infiltration skills. Because of this, she was recommended to be a special forces scout, and quickly rose up the ranks. 

One such scouting mission ended up in her being accidentally shot down by Khaliani air defences after escaping from an infiltration mission with bandits on her tail. 

After having to survive in the wilderness until CSAR found her, she decided to leave the system and was left with a difficulty of truly trusting people, especially low ranking soldiers. 

She ended up joining Sicario PMC, based on Absalom station,  after becoming intrigued with their operations as a light airborne based group made up of mainly special forces. There she became a renowned LACER pilot who was renowned for working alone. Those who worked with her discovered she was largely impulsive. She mainly dresses in black in her free time and has a hard time truly trusting others; but especially those not from an SF background. She keeps a cartridge on a necklace, and collects any which she deems as serving her well.
