# UN Transport Carrier "The Siege" // 1.26.5023u
A few weeks after **Carbonara** assembled the squad, they were formerly recruited by their new patron, UAD Officer **Anton "The Hand" Antonov**. Assigned to UN transport carrier "The Siege", the new Squad, chosen name **Papa-Oscar-Golf**, embarked to **Absalom Station**; a gargantuan Space Station in the rough center of the **Horus Sector** where **The Hand** is stationed and acting as a major liasion for the broader sector.

In the next days they will be familiarized with the sector and given a choice of mission... What wonders does this sector hold?
